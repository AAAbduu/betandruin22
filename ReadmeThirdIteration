										CreateRemoveEvent-view
										BrowseQuestions
										publish-result-view


A non-registered user will have the following flow:

Main-view ->

Once registered, he/she will become a user of Bet&Ruin and will have the following flow:

Main-view ->
			Login-view ->
						UserView ->
										BrowseQuestions
										bet-view
										addMoney
										(movements and current bets are shown here)

*GUI PACKAGE*



*BUSINESSLOGIC PACKAGE*

As every class has an attribute for a BlFacade object type, when an interaction needs to be done with the DB
the business layer is in charge of doing it, so for everything needed to be added in the DB, new classes mainly
and some new functionality like updating a users information, placing bets, removing events, publishing results and adding movements.
BlFacade has some new methods declared as for the new transactions needed, and BlFacadeImplementation has them
implemented.

*BUSINESSLOGIC PACKAGE*

*scheduler*

1- Scheduler is a clas which is formed by a timer and a timerTask, this way we have all in one. They are used in the MainGUIController
in order to request information every minute with some delay between them for not having problems of persistance in the database.

*scheduler*

*DATAACCESS PACKAGE*

The DataAccess class is in charge with direct communication with the database, that is why all persistance,
updating and checkings are done. Mainly it has implemented some new functions which persist new objects,
update other and checks for existance with JPA type queries.

*DATAACCESS PACKAGE*


Other features:
Add money has been implemented direclty in the user-view.

A table view has been implemented in the user view so all the bets placed by the logged-in user can be seen.

Tooltip appears if the mouse is placed on top of an event row in the user view when bets are placed. Tooltip
shows more information about the placed bet.

A bit of css has been added.

Other comments:
Maven was used for all the needed dependencies.

JavaFX has been used alongside SceneBuilder.

Having the layers executed in different machines has not being tried, since i don't have the machines for doing so.
Still i think the application should be able to work if executed in different machines.

A folder in the resources files named css contains some style sheets for the views, it is not complex so it has been hand-written
and the best has being tried having into account css+javafx limitations.

Intellij has being the tool for developing the project.

An automatization for answering 3 questions has been made, independently the language the current user is using.
For this, 2 timers have been placed in the MainGUIController, everytime the application is executed, they start requesting
information for the current date matches and publish results if some conditions are met.
The included competitions are just 2, LaLiga and UEFA Champions League.
